Unfortunately, the Great Depression finally meant the end for the Alcazar brand, despite its widespread popularity.&nbsp;<br>J.C. Newman offered to buy the rights to Alcazar and added the cigar to his company's lineup after realizing the huge potential of this forgotten brand. Given that the J.C. Newman Cigar Company still sells this legendary brand, it is obvious that J.C. had a keen eye for fine cigars.&nbsp;<br>Alcazar Maduros are still a popular cigar among smokers all across the country, and they are now a handcrafted Nicaraguan cigar that is sold in an economical bundle.</p>",active,ALCA,8000551A-1647351919,alcazar,1,98,"2023-01-02 18:45:01"
