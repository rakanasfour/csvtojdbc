7114,Criollo,Criollo,1113,87,"<p>Camacho is an old tried and true brand. It was a staple in most every cigar store. The odd thing was that only savvy smokers knew just how good the cigar actually was. Davidoff purchased the company some years back and spent a ton of money to repackage and relaunch the brand. Their efforts worked! Thousands of new smokers discovered what a great cigar Camacho is. As Davidoff expanded this brand’s offerings, more of us tried them and found a favorite. This 92 rated Criollo style is a smooth medium bodied stick. The key to this is the fourth generation, 12 year old Criollo wrapper. I was surprised to see this edition priced like the others.

The line then expanded to represent other states. At the time they were introduced, the “CIGAR POLICE” made sure they were never found in a store outside of an edition’s namesake state. They were and still are pretty expensive. Oddly enough, even after the aura of exclusivity wore off, the cigars continued to be made and sold. Why? Because when the dust cleared, they’re still exceptionally good medium bodied sticks. The New York cigar is blended at the renowned Tabacalera de Garcia, is box-pressed, un cellowed and finished with an absolutely beautiful Ecuadorian Habano wrapper. It’s smooth, balanced, draws perfectly and is a great smoking experience. The Texas blend is also box-pressed, un cellowed and more of a complex stick yielding a slightly elevated taste at the top of the medium bodied scale. Like it’s N.Y. cousin, it also draws well and is an enjoyable smoking experience as well. ***Keep in mind that I recommend NOT buying five of these sticks at a time.

The long fillers and binder contained in these box pressed vitolas are from 2012-2013 vintage crops. That alone makes for a great cigar. Where this cigar separates itself from virtually all premiums is the USA Connecticut grown Broadleaf wrapper and the harvesting method employed for this edition. We know that after leaves are cut from the plant they’re either stored, aged, cured, fermented or a combination thereof. The plants grown for this cigar wrapper are actually cut off at the stalks base. Then the entire plant is hung upside down in the curing barns to age. This process allows all the minerals, nutrients and oils to continue flowing into the leaves. The result is a totally unique tasting, smooth and balanced medium to full bodied highly rated cigar that became a top 25 cigar of the year in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Wrapper: Connecticut Broadleaf (2012)<br>Binder: Dominican Piloto (2010)<br>Filler: Dominican Olor (2012), Piloto (2012) &amp; Nicaragua Criollo</p>",inactive,STAL,80001E86-1498523877,henry-clay-stalk-cut,0,106,"2023-11-10 05:31:02"

This well made mellow to medium flavored stick was throwback to old school Florida craftsmanship. When the Sun Grown line came out in 2018 the Churchill garnered a 91 rating. Remember, this is a very affordable cigar! This medium-full bodied beautifully dark stick amps up the taste just a bit over the original Classic blend. However, this slow burning beauty seems as though it has double the amount of tobacco inside. Enjoy this great cigar. I highly recommend a five pack of churchills.

If you’re a fan of mild smokes you would have stood clear of this 90+ rated long time full bodied old school favorite. It still remains one of my favorites with whiskey. Drew Estate acquired the brand in 2018 and it wasnt long before they began reinventing this iconic brand. After launching the Red and Black editions (listed on our site) they turned to the Original and did what I never thought they could. In 2018 the Gran Reserva line was rated 93 and placed #16 as one of the best cigars of the year! While this stick has the same overall blend used in the Original, all the leaves were allowed to age a long, long time.

If you’re a fan of mild smokes you would have stood clear of this 90+ rated long time full bodied old school favorite. It still remains one of my favorites with whiskey.

Drew Estate acquired the brand in 2008 and it wasn’t long before they began reinventing this iconic brand. In honor of Joyas 45th anniversary the Master Blenders got together and created this box pressed masterpiece in 2015. By placing the 5 year old tobaccos in oak barrels and continuing to let it sit produces a complex, medium-full bodied smoke with an amazing draw. This 92 rated stick is still one of todays true Luxury cigars. I highly recommend buying a box of ten and smoking one every other month allowing the others to continue aging. This is a great smoking experience for any one.
